# Determining-the-age-of-buyers
## Project description:
The chain supermarket "Bread-Salt" introduces a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
- Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
- Monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.
## Project objectives üéØ:
It is necessary to build a model that can determine the approximate age of a person from a photo. The project has at its disposal a set of photos of people with an indication of their age.
## Brief conclusion from the project‚úçÔ∏è:
It was possible to train a neural model based on the **ResNet50** architecture on 3 epochs, adding to it an output fully connected layer with one neuron and the activation function **ReLU**, the final indicator of the quality metric of which **MAE** was ~7.83 on the test sample.
